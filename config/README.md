# Configuration for SONiC targets

This package describes flags, Bazel platforms and configuration settings to express the target machines
where the SONiC image will be deployed.

Traditionally, in Bazel, this would be called `platforms`, but that term already has meaning in the SONiC
community, so we'll avoid overloading it.
